In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if\nthe occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms\ndramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.\nIt came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a\nsteady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn’t speak. Then he turned his\nhead and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black\ntrousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved\naround on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose\ngrin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low,\nhiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was\nan older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silverrimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn’t have\non any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a\nblack hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\n“We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed.\n41\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she\nknew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him all her life but she could not\nrecall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment,\nplacing his feet carefully so that he wouldn’t slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks,\nand his ankles were red and thin. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I see you all had you a little spill.”\n“We turned over twice!” said the grandmother.\n“Oncet”, he corrected. “We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,” he\nsaid quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\n“What you got that gun for?” John Wesley asked. “Whatcha gonna do with that gun?”\n“Lady,” the man said to the children’s mother, “would you mind calling them children to\nsit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there\nwhere you’re at.”\n“What are you telling US what to do for?” June Star asked.\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. “Come here,” said their\nmother.\n“Look here now,” Bailey began suddenly, “we’re in a predicament! We’re in . . .”\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. “You’re The\nMisfit!” she said. “I recognized you at once!”\n“Yes’m,” the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be\nknown, “but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.”\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the\nchildren. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\n“Lady,” he said, “don’t you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don’t mean. I\ndon’t reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.”\n“You wouldn’t shoot a lady, would you?” the grandmother said and removed a clean\nhandkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then\ncovered it up again. “I would hate to have to,” he said.\n“Listen,” the grandmother almost screamed, “I know you’re a good man. You don’t look\na bit like you have common blood. I know you must come from nice people!”\n“Yes mam,” he said, “finest people in the world.” When he smiled he showed a row of\nstrong white teeth. “God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy’s heart was\npure gold,” he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was\nstanding with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. “Watch them\n42\nchildren, Bobby Lee,” he said. “You know they make me nervous.” He looked at the six of them\nhuddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn’t think of\nanything to say. “Ain’t a cloud in the sky,” he remarked, looking up at it. “Don’t see no sun but\ndon’t see no cloud neither.”\n“Yes, it’s a beautiful day,” said the grandmother. “Listen,” she said, “you shouldn’t call\nyourself The Misfit because I know you’re a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.”\n“Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!” He was\nsquatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn’t move.\n“I pre-chate that, lady,” The Misfit said and drew a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
