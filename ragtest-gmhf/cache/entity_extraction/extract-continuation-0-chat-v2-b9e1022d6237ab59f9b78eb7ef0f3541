He thown everything off balance. If He did what He said, then it’s\nnothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow Him, and if He didn’t, then it’s\nnothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can by killing\nsomebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure but\nmeanness,” he said and his voice had become almost a snarl.\n“Maybe He didn’t raise the dead,” the old lady mumbled, not knowing what she was\nsaying and feeling so dizzy that she sank down in the ditch with her legs twisted under her.\n“I wasn’t there so I can’t say He didn’t,” The Misfit said. “I wisht I had of been there,” he\nsaid, hitting the ground with his fist. “It ain’t right I wasn’t there because if I had of been there\nI would of known. Listen lady,” he said in a high voice, “if I had of been there I would of known\nand I wouldn’t be like I am now.” His voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother’s head\ncleared for an instant. She saw the man’s face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry\nand she murmured, “Why you’re one of my babies. You’re one of my own children !” She\nreached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten\nhim and shot her three times through the chest. Then he put his gun down on the ground and\ntook off his glasses and began to clean them.\nHiram and Bobby Lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down\nat the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under\nher like a child’s and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.\n46\nWithout his glasses, The Misfit’s eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenselesslooking. “Take her off and thow her where you thown the others,” he said, picking up the cat\nthat was rubbing itself against his leg.\n“She was a talker, wasn’t she?” Bobby Lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel.\n“She would of been a good woman,” The Misfit said, “if it had been somebody there to\nshoot her every minute of her life.”\n“Some fun!” Bobby Lee said.\n“Shut up, Bobby Lee,” The Misfit said. “It’s no real pleasure in life.”\n[1955]\n[Flannery O’Connor, A Good Man is Hard to Find and other stories, ed.
