She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her\nchair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children’s mother put in another\ndime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap\nroutine.\n“Ain’t she cute?” Red Sam’s wife said, leaning over the counter. “Would you like to come\nbe my little girl?”\n“No I certainly wouldn’t,” June Star said. “I wouldn’t live in a broken-down place like\nthis for a million bucks!” and she ran back to the table.\n“Ain’t she cute?” the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\n“Arn’t you ashamed?” hissed the grandmother.\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with\nthese people’s order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung\nover them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table\nnearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. “You can’t win,” he said. “You can’t win,” and\nhe wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. “These days you don’t know who\nto trust,” he said. “Ain’t that the truth?”\n“People are certainly not nice like they used to be,” said the grandmother.\n“Two fellers come in here last week,” Red Sammy said, “driving a Chrysler. It was a old\nbeat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked at the\nmill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?”\n“Because you’re a good man!” the grandmother said at once.\n“Yes’m, I suppose so,” Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in\neach hand and one balanced on her arm. “It isn’t a soul in this green world of God’s that you\ncan trust,” she said. “And I don’t count nobody out of that, not nobody,” she repeated, looking\nat Red Sammy.\n“Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that’s escaped?” asked the grandmother.\n38\n“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he didn’t attack this place right here,” said the woman.\n“If he hears about it being here, I wouldn’t be none surprised to see him. If he hears it’s two\ncent in the cash register, I wouldn’t be a tall surprised if he . . .”\n“That’ll do,” Red Sam said. “Go bring these people their Co’-Colas,” and the woman\nwent off to get the rest of the order.\n“A good man is hard to find,” Red Sammy said. “Everything is getting terrible. I\nremember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.”\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion\nEurope was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you\nwould think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was\nexactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the\nlacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully\nbetween his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke\nup every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled\nan old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady.\nShe said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks\nleading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down\nwith your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to\nit. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the\nmore she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin\narbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling\nthe truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in\nit when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .”\n“Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and\nfind it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?”\n“We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the\nhouse with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!”\n“It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty\nminutes.”\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JUNE STAR<|>PERSON<|>A child who danced and expressed a strong opinion about not wanting to live in a broken-down place like Red Sam's)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED SAM<|>PERSON<|>Owner of the establishment where the family stopped, discussed trust and the state of society with the grandmother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED SAM'S WIFE<|>PERSON<|>Helped serve the family, agreed with Red Sam about the lack of trust in society)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>PERSON<|>Engaged in conversation with Red Sam about the goodness of people and the state of the world, reminisced about an old plantation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAILEY<|>PERSON<|>The driver and presumably father in the family, resistant to the idea of detouring to see an old house)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MISFIT<|>PERSON<|>A criminal mentioned by the grandmother, speculated to be a threat to the area)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUNE STAR<|>RED SAM'S WIFE<|>Red Sam's wife found June Star cute and offered her to come be her little girl, which June Star declined<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RED SAM<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>Red Sam and the grandmother discussed the current state of society and trust<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RED SAM<|>RED SAM'S WIFE<|>Red Sam told his wife to hurry up with the order, indicating a working relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>BAILEY<|>The grandmother tried to persuade Bailey to visit an old house, showing a familial relationship<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>THE MISFIT<|>The grandmother brought up The Misfit in conversation, showing concern about his escape<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
