I can just look at you and tell.”\n“Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!” He was\nsquatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn’t move.\n“I pre-chate that, lady,” The Misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the\nbutt of his gun.\n“It’ll take a half a hour to fix this here car,” Hiram called, looking over the raised hood of\nit.\n“Well, first you and Bobby Lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you,”\nThe Misfit said, pointing to Bailey and John Wesley. “The boys want to ast you something,” he\nsaid to Bailey. “Would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?”\n“Listen,” Bailey began, “we’re in a terrible predicament! Nobody realizes what this is,”\nand his voice cracked. His eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he\nremained perfectly still.\nThe grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods\nwith him but it came off in her hand. She stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on\nthe ground. Hiram pulled Bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. John Wesley\ncaught hold of his father’s hand and Bobby Lee followed. They went off toward the woods and\njust as they reached the dark edge, Bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked\npine trunk, he shouted, “I’ll be back in a minute, Mamma, wait on me!”\n“Come back this instant!” his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.\n“Bailey Boy!” the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at\nThe Misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. “I just know you’re a good man,” she said\ndesperately. “You’re not a bit common!”\n“Nome, I ain’t a good man,” The Misfit said after a second ah if he had considered her\nstatement carefully, “but I ain’t the worst in the world neither. My daddy said I was a different\nbreed of dog from my brothers and sisters. ‘You know,’ Daddy said, ‘it’s some that can live their\nwhole life out without asking about it and it’s others has to know why it is, and this boy is one\nof the latters. He’s going to be into everything!”‘ He put on his black hat and looked up\nsuddenly and then away deep into the woods as if he were embarrassed again. “I’m sorry I\ndon’t have on a shirt before you ladies,” he said, hunching his shoulders slightly. “We buried\nour clothes that we had on when we escaped and we’re just making do until we can get better.\nWe borrowed these from some folks we met,” he explained.\n43\n“That’s perfectly all right,” the grandmother said. “Maybe Bailey has an extra shirt in his\nsuitcase.”\n“I’ll look and see terrectly,” The Misfit said.\n“Where are they taking him?” the children’s mother screamed.\n“Daddy was a card himself,” The Misfit said. “You couldn’t put anything over on him. He\nnever got in trouble with the Authorities though. Just had the knack of handling them.”\n“You could be honest too if you’d only try,” said the grandmother. “Think how\nwonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about\nsomebody chasing you all the time.”\nThe Misfit kept scratching in the ground with the butt of his gun as if he were thinking\nabout it. “Yes’m, somebody is always after you,” he murmured.\nThe grandmother noticed how thin his shoulder blades were just behind his hat because\nshe was standing up looking down on him. “Do you every pray?” she asked.\nHe shook his head. All she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades.\n“Nome,” he said.\nThere was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. Then silence. The\nold lady’s head jerked around. She could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long\nsatisfied insuck of breath. “Bailey Boy!” she called.\n“I was a gospel singer for a while,” The Misfit said. “I been most everything. Been in the\narm service both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker,\nbeen with the railroads, plowed Mother Earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive\noncet,” and he looked up at the children’s mother and the little girl who were sitting close\ntogether, their faces white and their eyes glassy; “I even seen a woman flogged,” he said.\n“Pray, pray,” the grandmother began, “pray, pray . . .”\n“I never was a bad boy that I remember of,” The Misfit said in an almost dreamy voice,\n“but somewheres along the line I done something wrong and got sent to the penitentiary. I was\nburied alive,” and he looked up and held her attention to him by a steady stare.\n“That’s when you should have started to pray,” she said. “What did you do to get sent to\nthe penitentiary that first time?”\n“Turn to the right, it was a wall,” The Misfit said, looking up again at\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BAILEY<|>PERSON<|>Bailey is involved in a tense situation with The Misfit and is taken into the woods along with his son, John Wesley)##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN WESLEY<|>PERSON<|>John Wesley is Bailey's son who is taken into the woods with his father by The Misfit's accomplices)##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MISFIT<|>PERSON<|>The Misfit is a criminal who encounters Bailey's family and engages in a philosophical conversation with the grandmother)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIRAM<|>PERSON<|>Hiram is one of The Misfit's accomplices, involved in the car's repair and the taking of Bailey and John Wesley into the woods)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOBBY LEE<|>PERSON<|>Bobby Lee is another accomplice of The Misfit, involved in taking Bailey and John Wesley into the woods)##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>PERSON<|>The grandmother tries to reason with The Misfit, believing in his goodness despite the situation)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAILEY<|>JOHN WESLEY<|>Bailey and John Wesley are father and son, taken together into the woods<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE MISFIT<|>BAILEY<|>The Misfit directs Bailey and John Wesley to be taken into the woods<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE MISFIT<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>The Misfit engages in a conversation with the grandmother about goodness and life<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIRAM<|>THE MISFIT<|>Hiram is an accomplice of The Misfit, assisting in the situation with Bailey's family<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOBBY LEE<|>THE MISFIT<|>Bobby Lee is an accomplice of The Misfit, assisting in the situation with Bailey's family<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>BAILEY<|>The grandmother is Bailey's mother, showing concern for him when he is taken into the woods<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>JOHN WESLEY<|>The grandmother is John Wesley's grandmother, indirectly shown through family ties<|>7)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
