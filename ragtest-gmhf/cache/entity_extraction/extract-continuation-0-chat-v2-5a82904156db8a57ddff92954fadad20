She wanted to visit some of her\nconnections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey’s mind.\nBailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the\ntable, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. “Now look here, Bailey,” she said,\n“see here, read this,” and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the\nnewspaper at his bald head. “Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the\nFederal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people.\nJust you read it. I wouldn’t take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in\nit. I couldn’t answer to my conscience if I did.”\nBailey didn’t look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the\nchildren’s mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a\ncabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like\nrabbit’s ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. “The\nchildren have been to Florida before,” the old lady said. “You all ought to take them somewhere\nelse for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have\nbeen to east Tennessee.”\nThe children’s mother didn’t seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley,\na stocky child with glasses, said, “If you don’t want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at\nhome?” He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home to be queen for a day,” June Star said without raising her\nyellow head.\n“Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?” the grandmother\nasked.\n“I’d smack his face,” John Wesley said.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home for a million bucks,” June Star said. “Afraid she’d miss\nsomething. She has to go everywhere we go.”\n“All right, Miss,” the grandmother said. “Just remember that the next time you want me\nto curl your hair.”\nJune Star said her hair was naturally curly.\nThe next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her\nbig black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it\nshe was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn’t intend for the cat to be left\nalone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he\nmight brush against one of her gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son,\nBailey, didn’t like to arrive at a motel with a cat.\n35\nShe sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of\nher. Bailey and the children’s mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight\nforty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she\nthought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It\ntook them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.\nThe old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting\nthem up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children’s mother still\nhad on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a\nnavy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with\na small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and\nat her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an\naccident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.\nShe said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too\ncold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the\npatrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you\nbefore you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone\nMountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the\nbrilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops that made rows of\ngreen lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of\nthem sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother and gone back to\nsleep.\n“Let’s go through Georgia fast so we won’t have to look at it much,” John Wesley said.\n“If I were a little boy,” said the grandmother, “I wouldn’t talk about my native state that\nway. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.”\n“Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,” John Wesley said, “and Georgia is a\nlousy state too.”\n“You said it,” June Star said.\n“In my time,” said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, “children were\nmore respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right\nthen. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!” she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in\nthe door\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>PERSON<|>A senior woman who expresses a strong preference for visiting east Tennessee over Florida, concerned about a criminal named The Misfit and is very involved with her family's decisions and safety)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAILEY<|>PERSON<|>The son of the grandmother, father to John Wesley and June Star, and husband to the children's mother, who is planning a family trip to Florida despite his mother's objections)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MISFIT<|>PERSON<|>A criminal who has escaped from the Federal Pen and is reportedly headed toward Florida, causing concern for the grandmother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN WESLEY<|>PERSON<|>A stocky eight-year-old boy with glasses, son of Bailey, who shows a casual indifference to the grandmother's concerns and exhibits a bold, somewhat disrespectful attitude towards states and individuals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNE STAR<|>PERSON<|>A young girl, sister to John Wesley, who is outspoken and shares her brother's lack of respect towards the grandmother's concerns and preferences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CHILDREN'S MOTHER<|>PERSON<|>A young woman in slacks, married to Bailey, mother to John Wesley and June Star, who appears indifferent to the grandmother's concerns and is focused on caring for the baby)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PITTY SING<|>PERSON<|>The family cat that the grandmother sneaks into the car because she fears it would miss her too much or get into danger if left alone at home)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATLANTA<|>GEO<|>The city from which the family departs for their trip to Florida)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>BAILEY<|>The Grandmother is Bailey's mother and is trying to persuade him against going to Florida due to safety concerns<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>THE MISFIT<|>The Grandmother is concerned about The Misfit's escape and his direction towards Florida, influencing her preference for the trip's destination<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAILEY<|>JOHN WESLEY<|>Bailey is the father of John Wesley<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAILEY<|>JUNE STAR<|>Bailey is the father of June Star<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN WESLEY<|>JUNE STAR<|>John Wesley and June Star are siblings<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CHILDREN'S MOTHER<|>JOHN WESLEY<|>The Children's Mother is John Wesley's mother<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CHILDREN'S MOTHER<|>JUNE STAR<|>The Children's Mother is June Star's mother<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE GRANDMOTHER<|>PITTY SING<|>The Grandmother is concerned about leaving Pitty Sing alone at home, indicating a caring relationship<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
