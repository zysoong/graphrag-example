I was\nburied alive,” and he looked up and held her attention to him by a steady stare.\n“That’s when you should have started to pray,” she said. “What did you do to get sent to\nthe penitentiary that first time?”\n“Turn to the right, it was a wall,” The Misfit said, looking up again at the cloudless sky.\n“Turn to the left, it was a wall. Look up it was a ceiling, look down it was a floor. I forget what I\ndone, lady. I set there and set there, trying to remember what it was I done and I ain’t recalled\nit to this day. Oncet in a while, I would think it was coming to me, but it never come.”\n“Maybe they put you in by mistake,” the old lady said vaguely.\n44\n“Nome,” he said. “It wasn’t no mistake. They had the papers on me.”\n“You must have stolen something,” she said.\nThe Misfit sneered slightly. “Nobody had nothing I wanted,” he said. “It was a headdoctor at the penitentiary said what I had done was kill my daddy but I known that for a lie. My\ndaddy died in nineteen ought nineteen of the epidemic flu and I never had a thing to do with it.\nHe was buried in the Mount Hopewell Baptist churchyard and you can go there and see for\nyourself.”\n“If you would pray,” the old lady said, “Jesus would help you.”\n“That’s right,” The Misfit said.\n“Well then, why don’t you pray?” she asked trembling with delight suddenly.\n“I don’t want no hep,” he said. “I’m doing all right by myself.”\nBobby Lee and Hiram came ambling back from the woods. Bobby Lee was dragging a\nyellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.\n“Thow me that shirt, Bobby Lee,” The Misfit said. The shirt came flying at him and\nlanded on his shoulder and he put it on. The grandmother couldn’t name what the shirt\nreminded her of. “No, lady,” The Misfit said while he was buttoning it up, “I found out the\ncrime don’t matter. You can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his\ncar, because sooner or later you’re going to forget what it was you done and just be punished\nfor it.”\nThe children’s mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn’t get her\nbreath. “Lady,” he asked, “would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with Bobby Lee\nand Hiram and join your husband?”\n“Yes, thank you,” the mother said faintly. Her left arm dangled helplessly and she was\nholding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. “Hep that lady up, Hiram,” The Misfit\nsaid as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, “and Bobby Lee, you hold onto that little girl’s\nhand.”\n“I don’t want to hold hands with him,” June Star said. “He reminds me of a pig.”\nThe fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the\nwoods after Hiram and her mother.\nAlone with The Misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. There was not\na cloud in the sky nor any sun. There was nothing around her but woods. She wanted to tell\nhim that he must pray. She opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came\nout. Finally she found herself saying, “Jesus. Jesus,” meaning, Jesus will help you, but the way\nshe was saying it, it sounded as if she might be cursing.\n45\n“Yes’m,” The Misfit said as if he agreed. “Jesus thown everything off balance. It was the\nsame case with Him as with me except He hadn’t committed any crime and they could prove I\nhad committed one because they had the papers on me. Of course,” he said, “they never shown\nme my papers. That’s why I sign myself now. I said long ago, you get you a signature and sign\neverything you do and keep a copy of it. Then you’ll know what you done and you can hold up\nthe crime to the punishment and see do they match and in the end you’ll have something to\nprove you ain’t been treated right. I call myself The Misfit,” he said, “because I can’t make what\nall I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment.”\nThere was a piercing scream from the woods, followed closely by a pistol report. “Does it\nseem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain’t punished at all?”\n“Jesus!” the old lady cried. “You’ve got good blood! I know you wouldn’t shoot a lady! I\nknow you come from nice people! Pray! Jesus, you ought not to shoot a lady. I’ll give you all the\nmoney I’ve got!”\n“Lady,” The Misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, “there never was a body\nthat give the undertaker a tip.”\nThere were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched\nold turkey hen crying for water and called, “Bailey Boy, Bailey Boy!” as if her heart would\nbreak.\n“Jesus was the only One that ever raised the dead,” The Misfit continued, “and He\nshouldn’t have done it.
