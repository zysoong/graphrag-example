People did right\nthen. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!” she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in\nthe door of a shack. “Wouldn’t that make a picture, now?” she asked and they all turned and\nlooked at the little Negro out of the back window. He waved.\n“He didn’t have any britches on,” June Star said.\n“He probably didn’t have any,” the grandmother explained. “Little riggers in the country\ndon’t have things like we do. If I could paint, I’d paint that picture,” she said.\nThe children exchanged comic books.\n36\nThe grandmother offered to hold the baby and the children’s mother passed him over\nthe front seat to her. She set him on her knee and bounced him and told him about the things\nthey were passing. She rolled her eyes and screwed up her mouth and stuck her leathery thin\nface into his smooth bland one. Occasionally he gave her a faraway smile. They passed a large\ncotton field with five or fix graves fenced in the middle of it, like a small island. “Look at the\ngraveyard!” the grandmother said, pointing it out. “That was the old family burying ground.\nThat belonged to the plantation.”\n“Where’s the plantation?” John Wesley asked.\n“Gone With the Wind,” said the grandmother. “Ha. Ha.”\nWhen the children finished all the comic books they had brought, they opened the lunch\nand ate it. The grandmother ate a peanut butter sandwich and an olive and would not let the\nchildren throw the box and the paper napkins out the window. When there was nothing else to\ndo they played a game by choosing a cloud and making the other two guess what shape it\nsuggested. John Wesley took one the shape of a cow and June Star guessed a cow and John\nWesley said, no, an automobile, and June Star said he didn’t play fair, and they began to slap\neach other over the grandmother.\nThe grandmother said she would tell them a story if they would keep quiet. When she\ntold a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic. She said once\nwhen she was a maiden lady she had been courted by a Mr. Edgar Atkins Teagarden from\nJasper, Georgia. She said he was a very good-looking man and a gentleman and that he\nbrought her a watermelon every Saturday afternoon with his initials cut in it, E. A. T. Well, one\nSaturday, she said, Mr. Teagarden brought the watermelon and there was nobody at home and\nhe left it on the front porch and returned in his buggy to Jasper, but she never got the\nwatermelon, she said, because a nigger boy ate it when he saw the initials, E. A. T. ! This story\ntickled John Wesley’s funny bone and he giggled and giggled but June Star didn’t think it was\nany good. She said she wouldn’t marry a man that just brought her a watermelon on Saturday.\nThe grandmother said she would have done well to marry Mr. Teagarden because he was a\ngentle man and had bought Coca-Cola stock when it first came out and that he had died only a\nfew years ago, a very wealthy man.\nThey stopped at The Tower for barbecued sandwiches. The Tower was a part stucco and\npart wood filling station and dance hall set in a clearing outside of Timothy. A fat man named\nRed Sammy Butts ran it and there were signs stuck here and there on the building and for\nmiles up and down the highway saying, TRY RED SAMMY’S FAMOUS BARBECUE. NONE\nLIKE FAMOUS RED SAMMY’S! RED SAM! THE FAT BOY WITH THE HAPPY LAUGH. A\nVETERAN! RED SAMMY’S YOUR MAN!\nRed Sammy was lying on the bare ground outside The Tower with his head under a\ntruck while a gray monkey about a foot high, chained to a small chinaberry tree, chattered\nnearby. The monkey sprang back into the tree and got on the highest limb as soon as he saw\nthe children jump out of the car and run toward him.\n37\nInside, The Tower was a long dark room with a counter at one end and tables at the\nother and dancing space in the middle. They all sat down at a board table next to the\nnickelodeon and Red Sam’s wife, a tall burnt-brown woman with hair and eyes lighter than her\nskin, came and took their order. The children’s mother put a dime in the machine and played\n“The Tennessee Waltz,” and the grandmother said that tune always made her want to dance.\nShe asked Bailey if he would like to dance but he only glared at her. He didn’t have a naturally\nsunny disposition like she did and trips made him nervous. The grandmother’s brown eyes\nwere very bright. She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her\nchair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children’s mother put in another\ndime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap\nroutine.\n“Ain’t she cute?” Red Sam’s wife said, leaning over the counter. “Would you like to come\nbe my little girl?”\n“No\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
