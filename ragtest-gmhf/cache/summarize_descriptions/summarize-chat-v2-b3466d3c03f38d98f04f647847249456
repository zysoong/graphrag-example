He is infamously known for having escaped from the Federal Penitentiary and is believed to be making his way toward Florida, a detail that significantly concerns the grandmother. The Misfit is characterized by his complex discussions on crime, punishment, and morality, particularly highlighting his own philosophy and the assertion that he was wrongly accused of killing his father. His interactions are deeply philosophical, especially notable in his conversations about Jesus and morality, which culminate in the tragic killing of the grandmother.\n\nAn older man, The Misfit is depicted as possibly leading two other men, indicating a position of authority or influence within his group. His encounter with Bailey's family is marked by a tense and foreboding atmosphere, as he carries a gun and engages in a significant conversation with the grandmother.
