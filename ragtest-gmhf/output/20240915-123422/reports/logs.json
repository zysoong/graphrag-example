She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her\nchair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children’s mother put in another\ndime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap\nroutine.\n“Ain’t she cute?” Red Sam’s wife said, leaning over the counter. “Would you like to come\nbe my little girl?”\n“No I certainly wouldn’t,” June Star said. “I wouldn’t live in a broken-down place like\nthis for a million bucks!” and she ran back to the table.\n“Ain’t she cute?” the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\n“Arn’t you ashamed?” hissed the grandmother.\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with\nthese people’s order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung\nover them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table\nnearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. “You can’t win,” he said. “You can’t win,” and\nhe wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. “These days you don’t know who\nto trust,” he said. “Ain’t that the truth?”\n“People are certainly not nice like they used to be,” said the grandmother.\n“Two fellers come in here last week,” Red Sammy said, “driving a Chrysler. It was a old\nbeat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked at the\nmill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?”\n“Because you’re a good man!” the grandmother said at once.\n“Yes’m, I suppose so,” Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in\neach hand and one balanced on her arm. “It isn’t a soul in this green world of God’s that you\ncan trust,” she said. “And I don’t count nobody out of that, not nobody,” she repeated, looking\nat Red Sammy.\n“Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that’s escaped?” asked the grandmother.\n38\n“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he didn’t attack this place right here,” said the woman.\n“If he hears about it being here, I wouldn’t be none surprised to see him. If he hears it’s two\ncent in the cash register, I wouldn’t be a tall surprised if he . . .”\n“That’ll do,” Red Sam said. “Go bring these people their Co’-Colas,” and the woman\nwent off to get the rest of the order.\n“A good man is hard to find,” Red Sammy said. “Everything is getting terrible. I\nremember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.”\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion\nEurope was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you\nwould think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was\nexactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the\nlacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully\nbetween his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke\nup every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled\nan old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady.\nShe said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks\nleading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down\nwith your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to\nit. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the\nmore she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin\narbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling\nthe truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in\nit when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .”\n“Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and\nfind it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?”\n“We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the\nhouse with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!”\n“It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty\nminutes.”\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She wanted to visit some of her\nconnections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey’s mind.\nBailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the\ntable, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. “Now look here, Bailey,” she said,\n“see here, read this,” and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the\nnewspaper at his bald head. “Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the\nFederal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people.\nJust you read it. I wouldn’t take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in\nit. I couldn’t answer to my conscience if I did.”\nBailey didn’t look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the\nchildren’s mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a\ncabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like\nrabbit’s ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. “The\nchildren have been to Florida before,” the old lady said. “You all ought to take them somewhere\nelse for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have\nbeen to east Tennessee.”\nThe children’s mother didn’t seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley,\na stocky child with glasses, said, “If you don’t want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at\nhome?” He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home to be queen for a day,” June Star said without raising her\nyellow head.\n“Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?” the grandmother\nasked.\n“I’d smack his face,” John Wesley said.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home for a million bucks,” June Star said. “Afraid she’d miss\nsomething. She has to go everywhere we go.”\n“All right, Miss,” the grandmother said. “Just remember that the next time you want me\nto curl your hair.”\nJune Star said her hair was naturally curly.\nThe next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her\nbig black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it\nshe was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn’t intend for the cat to be left\nalone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he\nmight brush against one of her gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son,\nBailey, didn’t like to arrive at a motel with a cat.\n35\nShe sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of\nher. Bailey and the children’s mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight\nforty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she\nthought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It\ntook them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.\nThe old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting\nthem up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children’s mother still\nhad on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a\nnavy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with\na small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and\nat her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an\naccident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.\nShe said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too\ncold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the\npatrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you\nbefore you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone\nMountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the\nbrilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops that made rows of\ngreen lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of\nthem sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother and gone back to\nsleep.\n“Let’s go through Georgia fast so we won’t have to look at it much,” John Wesley said.\n“If I were a little boy,” said the grandmother, “I wouldn’t talk about my native state that\nway.

His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and\nJohn Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his\nkidney.\n39\n“All right!” he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. “Will you all\nshut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don’t shut up, we won’t go anywhere.”\n“It would be very educational for them,” the grandmother murmured.\n“All right,” Bailey said, “but get this: this is the only time we’re going to stop for\nanything like this. This is the one and only time.”\n“The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,” the grandmother\ndirected. “I marked it when we passed.”\n“A dirt road,” Bailey groaned.\nAfter they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother\nrecalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the\ncandle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.\n“You can’t go inside this house,” Bailey said. “You don’t know who lives there.”\n“While you all talk to the people in front, I’ll run around behind and get in a window,”\nJohn Wesley suggested.\n“We’ll all stay in the car,” his mother said.\nThey turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust.\nThe grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a\nday’s journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on\ndangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops\nof trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the\ndust-coated trees looking down on them.\n“This place had better turn up in a minute,” Bailey said, “or I’m going to turn around.”\nThe road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.\n“It’s not much farther,” the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought\ncame to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes\ndilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise\nmoved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing, the\ncat, sprang onto Bailey’s shoulder.\nThe children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown\nout the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over\nonce and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the\ndriver’s seat with the cat gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose clinging to\nhis neck like a caterpillar.\nAs soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of\nthe car, shouting, “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” The grandmother was curled up under the\n40\ndashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey’s wrath would not come down on her all at\nonce. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had\nremembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.\nBailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window\nagainst the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children’s\nmother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby,\nbut she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the\nchildren screamed in a frenzy of delight.\n“But nobody’s killed,” June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped\nout of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty\nangle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the\nchildren, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.\n“Maybe a car will come along,” said the children’s mother hoarsely.\n“I believe I have injured an organ,” said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one\nanswered her. Bailey’s teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue\nparrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the shirt. The grandmother decided that she\nwould not mention that the house was in Tennessee.\nThe road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the\nother side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and\ndeep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if\nthe occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms\ndramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered he\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The grandmother stood up and waved both arms\ndramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.\nIt came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a\nsteady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn’t speak. Then he turned his\nhead and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black\ntrousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved\naround on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose\ngrin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low,\nhiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was\nan older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silverrimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn’t have\non any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a\nblack hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\n“We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed.\n41\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she\nknew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him all her life but she could not\nrecall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment,\nplacing his feet carefully so that he wouldn’t slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks,\nand his ankles were red and thin. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I see you all had you a little spill.”\n“We turned over twice!” said the grandmother.\n“Oncet”, he corrected. “We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,” he\nsaid quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\n“What you got that gun for?” John Wesley asked. “Whatcha gonna do with that gun?”\n“Lady,” the man said to the children’s mother, “would you mind calling them children to\nsit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there\nwhere you’re at.”\n“What are you telling US what to do for?” June Star asked.\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. “Come here,” said their\nmother.\n“Look here now,” Bailey began suddenly, “we’re in a predicament! We’re in . . .”\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. “You’re The\nMisfit!” she said. “I recognized you at once!”\n“Yes’m,” the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be\nknown, “but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.”\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the\nchildren. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\n“Lady,” he said, “don’t you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don’t mean. I\ndon’t reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.”\n“You wouldn’t shoot a lady, would you?” the grandmother said and removed a clean\nhandkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then\ncovered it up again. “I would hate to have to,” he said.\n“Listen,” the grandmother almost screamed, “I know you’re a good man. You don’t look\na bit like you have common blood.

The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was\nstanding with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. “Watch them\n42\nchildren, Bobby Lee,” he said. “You know they make me nervous.” He looked at the six of them\nhuddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn’t think of\nanything to say. “Ain’t a cloud in the sky,” he remarked, looking up at it. “Don’t see no sun but\ndon’t see no cloud neither.”\n“Yes, it’s a beautiful day,” said the grandmother. “Listen,” she said, “you shouldn’t call\nyourself The Misfit because I know you’re a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.”\n“Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush!

She wanted to visit some of her\nconnections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey’s mind.\nBailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the\ntable, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. “Now look here, Bailey,” she said,\n“see here, read this,” and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the\nnewspaper at his bald head. “Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the\nFederal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people.\nJust you read it. I wouldn’t take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in\nit. I couldn’t answer to my conscience if I did.”\nBailey didn’t look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the\nchildren’s mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a\ncabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like\nrabbit’s ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. “The\nchildren have been to Florida before,” the old lady said. “You all ought to take them somewhere\nelse for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have\nbeen to east Tennessee.”\nThe children’s mother didn’t seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley,\na stocky child with glasses, said, “If you don’t want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at\nhome?” He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home to be queen for a day,” June Star said without raising her\nyellow head.\n“Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?” the grandmother\nasked.\n“I’d smack his face,” John Wesley said.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home for a million bucks,” June Star said. “Afraid she’d miss\nsomething. She has to go everywhere we go.”\n“All right, Miss,” the grandmother said. “Just remember that the next time you want me\nto curl your hair.”\nJune Star said her hair was naturally curly.\nThe next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her\nbig black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it\nshe was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn’t intend for the cat to be left\nalone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he\nmight brush against one of her gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son,\nBailey, didn’t like to arrive at a motel with a cat.\n35\nShe sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of\nher. Bailey and the children’s mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight\nforty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she\nthought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It\ntook them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.\nThe old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting\nthem up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children’s mother still\nhad on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a\nnavy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with\na small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and\nat her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an\naccident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.\nShe said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too\ncold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the\npatrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you\nbefore you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone\nMountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the\nbrilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops that made rows of\ngreen lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of\nthem sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother and gone back to\nsleep.\n“Let’s go through Georgia fast so we won’t have to look at it much,” John Wesley said.\n“If I were a little boy,” said the grandmother, “I wouldn’t talk about my native state that\nway. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.”\n“Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,” John Wesley said, “and Georgia is a\nlousy state too.”\n“You said it,” June Star said.\n“In my time,” said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, “children were\nmore respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right\nthen. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!” she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in\nthe door\n######################\nOutput:"}}

His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and\nJohn Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his\nkidney.\n39\n“All right!” he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. “Will you all\nshut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don’t shut up, we won’t go anywhere.”\n“It would be very educational for them,” the grandmother murmured.\n“All right,” Bailey said, “but get this: this is the only time we’re going to stop for\nanything like this. This is the one and only time.”\n“The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,” the grandmother\ndirected. “I marked it when we passed.”\n“A dirt road,” Bailey groaned.\nAfter they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother\nrecalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the\ncandle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.\n“You can’t go inside this house,” Bailey said. “You don’t know who lives there.”\n“While you all talk to the people in front, I’ll run around behind and get in a window,”\nJohn Wesley suggested.\n“We’ll all stay in the car,” his mother said.\nThey turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust.\nThe grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a\nday’s journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on\ndangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops\nof trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the\ndust-coated trees looking down on them.\n“This place had better turn up in a minute,” Bailey said, “or I’m going to turn around.”\nThe road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.\n“It’s not much farther,” the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought\ncame to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes\ndilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise\nmoved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing, the\ncat, sprang onto Bailey’s shoulder.\nThe children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown\nout the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over\nonce and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the\ndriver’s seat with the cat gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose clinging to\nhis neck like a caterpillar.\nAs soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of\nthe car, shouting, “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” The grandmother was curled up under the\n40\ndashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey’s wrath would not come down on her all at\nonce. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had\nremembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.\nBailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window\nagainst the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children’s\nmother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby,\nbut she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the\nchildren screamed in a frenzy of delight.\n“But nobody’s killed,” June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped\nout of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty\nangle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the\nchildren, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.\n“Maybe a car will come along,” said the children’s mother hoarsely.\n“I believe I have injured an organ,” said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one\nanswered her. Bailey’s teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue\nparrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the shirt. The grandmother decided that she\nwould not mention that the house was in Tennessee.\nThe road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the\nother side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and\ndeep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if\nthe occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms\ndramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered he\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The grandmother stood up and waved both arms\ndramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.\nIt came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a\nsteady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn’t speak. Then he turned his\nhead and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black\ntrousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved\naround on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose\ngrin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low,\nhiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was\nan older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silverrimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn’t have\non any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a\nblack hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\n“We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed.\n41\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she\nknew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him all her life but she could not\nrecall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment,\nplacing his feet carefully so that he wouldn’t slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks,\nand his ankles were red and thin. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I see you all had you a little spill.”\n“We turned over twice!” said the grandmother.\n“Oncet”, he corrected. “We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,” he\nsaid quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\n“What you got that gun for?” John Wesley asked. “Whatcha gonna do with that gun?”\n“Lady,” the man said to the children’s mother, “would you mind calling them children to\nsit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there\nwhere you’re at.”\n“What are you telling US what to do for?” June Star asked.\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. “Come here,” said their\nmother.\n“Look here now,” Bailey began suddenly, “we’re in a predicament! We’re in . . .”\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. “You’re The\nMisfit!” she said. “I recognized you at once!”\n“Yes’m,” the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be\nknown, “but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.”\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the\nchildren. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\n“Lady,” he said, “don’t you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don’t mean. I\ndon’t reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.”\n“You wouldn’t shoot a lady, would you?” the grandmother said and removed a clean\nhandkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then\ncovered it up again. “I would hate to have to,” he said.\n“Listen,” the grandmother almost screamed, “I know you’re a good man. You don’t look\na bit like you have common blood. I know you must come from nice people!”\n“Yes mam,” he said, “finest people in the world.” When he smiled he showed a row of\nstrong white teeth. “God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy’s heart was\npure gold,” he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was\nstanding with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. “Watch them\n42\nchildren, Bobby Lee,” he said. “You know they make me nervous.” He looked at the six of them\nhuddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn’t think of\nanything to say. “Ain’t a cloud in the sky,” he remarked, looking up at it. “Don’t see no sun but\ndon’t see no cloud neither.”\n“Yes, it’s a beautiful day,” said the grandmother. “Listen,” she said, “you shouldn’t call\nyourself The Misfit because I know you’re a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.”\n“Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!” He was\nsquatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn’t move.\n“I pre-chate that, lady,” The Misfit said and drew a\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her\nchair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children’s mother put in another\ndime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap\nroutine.\n“Ain’t she cute?” Red Sam’s wife said, leaning over the counter. “Would you like to come\nbe my little girl?”\n“No I certainly wouldn’t,” June Star said. “I wouldn’t live in a broken-down place like\nthis for a million bucks!” and she ran back to the table.\n“Ain’t she cute?” the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\n“Arn’t you ashamed?” hissed the grandmother.\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with\nthese people’s order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung\nover them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table\nnearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. “You can’t win,” he said. “You can’t win,” and\nhe wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. “These days you don’t know who\nto trust,” he said. “Ain’t that the truth?”\n“People are certainly not nice like they used to be,” said the grandmother.\n“Two fellers come in here last week,” Red Sammy said, “driving a Chrysler. It was a old\nbeat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked at the\nmill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?”\n“Because you’re a good man!” the grandmother said at once.\n“Yes’m, I suppose so,” Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in\neach hand and one balanced on her arm. “It isn’t a soul in this green world of God’s that you\ncan trust,” she said. “And I don’t count nobody out of that, not nobody,” she repeated, looking\nat Red Sammy.\n“Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that’s escaped?” asked the grandmother.\n38\n“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he didn’t attack this place right here,” said the woman.\n“If he hears about it being here, I wouldn’t be none surprised to see him. If he hears it’s two\ncent in the cash register, I wouldn’t be a tall surprised if he . . .”\n“That’ll do,” Red Sam said. “Go bring these people their Co’-Colas,” and the woman\nwent off to get the rest of the order.\n“A good man is hard to find,” Red Sammy said. “Everything is getting terrible. I\nremember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.”\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion\nEurope was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you\nwould think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was\nexactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the\nlacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully\nbetween his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke\nup every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled\nan old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady.\nShe said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks\nleading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down\nwith your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to\nit. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the\nmore she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin\narbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling\nthe truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in\nit when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .”\n“Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and\nfind it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?”\n“We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the\nhouse with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!”\n“It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty\nminutes.”\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She wanted to visit some of her\nconnections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey’s mind.\nBailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the\ntable, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. “Now look here, Bailey,” she said,\n“see here, read this,” and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the\nnewspaper at his bald head. “Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the\nFederal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people.\nJust you read it. I wouldn’t take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in\nit. I couldn’t answer to my conscience if I did.”\nBailey didn’t look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the\nchildren’s mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a\ncabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like\nrabbit’s ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. “The\nchildren have been to Florida before,” the old lady said. “You all ought to take them somewhere\nelse for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have\nbeen to east Tennessee.”\nThe children’s mother didn’t seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley,\na stocky child with glasses, said, “If you don’t want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at\nhome?” He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home to be queen for a day,” June Star said without raising her\nyellow head.\n“Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?” the grandmother\nasked.\n“I’d smack his face,” John Wesley said.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home for a million bucks,” June Star said. “Afraid she’d miss\nsomething. She has to go everywhere we go.”\n“All right, Miss,” the grandmother said. “Just remember that the next time you want me\nto curl your hair.”\nJune Star said her hair was naturally curly.\nThe next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her\nbig black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it\nshe was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn’t intend for the cat to be left\nalone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he\nmight brush against one of her gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son,\nBailey, didn’t like to arrive at a motel with a cat.\n35\nShe sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of\nher. Bailey and the children’s mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight\nforty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she\nthought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It\ntook them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.\nThe old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting\nthem up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children’s mother still\nhad on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a\nnavy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with\na small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and\nat her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an\naccident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.\nShe said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too\ncold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the\npatrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you\nbefore you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone\nMountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the\nbrilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops that made rows of\ngreen lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of\nthem sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother and gone back to\nsleep.\n“Let’s go through Georgia fast so we won’t have to look at it much,” John Wesley said.\n“If I were a little boy,” said the grandmother, “I wouldn’t talk about my native state that\nway. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.”\n“Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,” John Wesley said, “and Georgia is a\nlousy state too.”\n“You said it,” June Star said.\n“In my time,” said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, “children were\nmore respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right\nthen. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!” she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in\nthe door\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled\nan old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady.\nShe said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks\nleading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down\nwith your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to\nit. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the\nmore she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin\narbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling\nthe truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in\nit when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .”\n“Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and\nfind it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?”\n“We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the\nhouse with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!”\n“It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty\nminutes.”\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what\n######################\nOutput:"}}

His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and\nJohn Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his\nkidney.\n39\n“All right!” he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. “Will you all\nshut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don’t shut up, we won’t go anywhere.”\n“It would be very educational for them,” the grandmother murmured.\n“All right,” Bailey said, “but get this: this is the only time we’re going to stop for\nanything like this. This is the one and only time.”\n“The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,” the grandmother\ndirected. “I marked it when we passed.”\n“A dirt road,” Bailey groaned.\nAfter they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother\nrecalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the\ncandle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.\n“You can’t go inside this house,” Bailey said. “You don’t know who lives there.”\n“While you all talk to the people in front, I’ll run around behind and get in a window,”\nJohn Wesley suggested.\n“We’ll all stay in the car,” his mother said.\nThey turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust.\nThe grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a\nday’s journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on\ndangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops\nof trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the\ndust-coated trees looking down on them.\n“This place had better turn up in a minute,” Bailey said, “or I’m going to turn around.”\nThe road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.\n“It’s not much farther,” the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought\ncame to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes\ndilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise\nmoved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing, the\ncat, sprang onto Bailey’s shoulder.\nThe children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown\nout the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over\nonce and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the\ndriver’s seat with the cat gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose clinging to\nhis neck like a caterpillar.\nAs soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of\nthe car, shouting, “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” The grandmother was curled up under the\n40\ndashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey’s wrath would not come down on her all at\nonce. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had\nremembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.\nBailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window\nagainst the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children’s\nmother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby,\nbut she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the\nchildren screamed in a frenzy of delight.\n“But nobody’s killed,” June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped\nout of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty\nangle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the\nchildren, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.\n“Maybe a car will come along,” said the children’s mother hoarsely.\n“I believe I have injured an organ,” said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one\nanswered her. Bailey’s teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue\nparrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the shirt. The grandmother decided that she\nwould not mention that the house was in Tennessee.\nThe road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the\nother side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and\ndeep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if\nthe occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms\ndramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered he\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.\nIt came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a\nsteady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn’t speak. Then he turned his\nhead and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black\ntrousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved\naround on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose\ngrin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low,\nhiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was\nan older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silverrimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn’t have\non any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a\nblack hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\n“We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed.\n41\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she\nknew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him all her life but she could not\nrecall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment,\nplacing his feet carefully so that he wouldn’t slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks,\nand his ankles were red and thin. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I see you all had you a little spill.”\n“We turned over twice!” said the grandmother.\n“Oncet”, he corrected. “We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,” he\nsaid quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\n“What you got that gun for?” John Wesley asked. “Whatcha gonna do with that gun?”\n“Lady,” the man said to the children’s mother, “would you mind calling them children to\nsit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there\nwhere you’re at.”\n“What are you telling US what to do for?” June Star asked.\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. “Come here,” said their\nmother.\n“Look here now,” Bailey began suddenly, “we’re in a predicament!

She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. “You’re The\nMisfit!” she said. “I recognized you at once!”\n“Yes’m,” the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be\nknown, “but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.”\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the\nchildren. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\n“Lady,” he said, “don’t you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don’t mean. I\ndon’t reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.”\n“You wouldn’t shoot a lady, would you?” the grandmother said and removed a clean\nhandkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then\ncovered it up again. “I would hate to have to,” he said.\n“Listen,” the grandmother almost screamed, “I know you’re a good man. You don’t look\na bit like you have common blood. I know you must come from nice people!”\n“Yes mam,” he said, “finest people in the world.” When he smiled he showed a row of\nstrong white teeth. “God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy’s heart was\npure gold,” he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was\nstanding with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. “Watch them\n42\nchildren, Bobby Lee,” he said. “You know they make me nervous.” He looked at the six of them\nhuddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn’t think of\nanything to say. “Ain’t a cloud in the sky,” he remarked, looking up at it. “Don’t see no sun but\ndon’t see no cloud neither.”\n“Yes, it’s a beautiful day,” said the grandmother. “Listen,” she said, “you shouldn’t call\nyourself The Misfit because I know you’re a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.”\n“Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!” He was\nsquatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn’t move.\n“I pre-chate that, lady,” The Misfit said and drew a\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She wanted to visit some of her\nconnections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey’s mind.\nBailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the\ntable, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. “Now look here, Bailey,” she said,\n“see here, read this,” and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the\nnewspaper at his bald head. “Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the\nFederal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people.\nJust you read it. I wouldn’t take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in\nit. I couldn’t answer to my conscience if I did.”\nBailey didn’t look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the\nchildren’s mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a\ncabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like\nrabbit’s ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. “The\nchildren have been to Florida before,” the old lady said. “You all ought to take them somewhere\nelse for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have\nbeen to east Tennessee.”\nThe children’s mother didn’t seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley,\na stocky child with glasses, said, “If you don’t want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at\nhome?” He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home to be queen for a day,” June Star said without raising her\nyellow head.\n“Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?” the grandmother\nasked.\n“I’d smack his face,” John Wesley said.\n“She wouldn’t stay at home for a million bucks,” June Star said. “Afraid she’d miss\nsomething. She has to go everywhere we go.”\n“All right, Miss,” the grandmother said. “Just remember that the next time you want me\nto curl your hair.”\nJune Star said her hair was naturally curly.\nThe next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her\nbig black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it\nshe was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn’t intend for the cat to be left\nalone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he\nmight brush against one of her gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son,\nBailey, didn’t like to arrive at a motel with a cat.\n35\nShe sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of\nher. Bailey and the children’s mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight\nforty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she\nthought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It\ntook them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.\nThe old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting\nthem up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children’s mother still\nhad on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a\nnavy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with\na small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and\nat her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an\naccident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.\nShe said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too\ncold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the\npatrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you\nbefore you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone\nMountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the\nbrilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops that made rows of\ngreen lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of\nthem sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother and gone back to\nsleep.\n“Let’s go through Georgia fast so we won’t have to look at it much,” John Wesley said.\n“If I were a little boy,” said the grandmother, “I wouldn’t talk about my native state that\nway. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.”\n“Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,” John Wesley said, “and Georgia is a\nlousy state too.”\n“You said it,” June Star said.\n“In my time,” said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, “children were\nmore respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right\nthen. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!” she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in\nthe door\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if\nthe occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms\ndramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.\nIt came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a\nsteady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn’t speak. Then he turned his\nhead and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black\ntrousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved\naround on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose\ngrin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low,\nhiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was\nan older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silverrimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn’t have\non any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a\nblack hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\n“We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed.\n41\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she\nknew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him all her life but she could not\nrecall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment,\nplacing his feet carefully so that he wouldn’t slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks,\nand his ankles were red and thin. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I see you all had you a little spill.”\n“We turned over twice!” said the grandmother.\n“Oncet”, he corrected. “We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,” he\nsaid quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\n“What you got that gun for?” John Wesley asked. “Whatcha gonna do with that gun?”\n“Lady,” the man said to the children’s mother, “would you mind calling them children to\nsit down by you? Children make me nervous.

She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. “You’re The\nMisfit!” she said. “I recognized you at once!”\n“Yes’m,” the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be\nknown, “but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.”\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the\nchildren. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\n“Lady,” he said, “don’t you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don’t mean. I\ndon’t reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.”\n“You wouldn’t shoot a lady, would you?” the grandmother said and removed a clean\nhandkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then\ncovered it up again. “I would hate to have to,” he said.\n“Listen,” the grandmother almost screamed, “I know you’re a good man. You don’t look\na bit like you have common blood. I know you must come from nice people!”\n“Yes mam,” he said, “finest people in the world.” When he smiled he showed a row of\nstrong white teeth. “God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy’s heart was\npure gold,” he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was\nstanding with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. “Watch them\n42\nchildren, Bobby Lee,” he said. “You know they make me nervous.” He looked at the six of them\nhuddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn’t think of\nanything to say. “Ain’t a cloud in the sky,” he remarked, looking up at it. “Don’t see no sun but\ndon’t see no cloud neither.”\n“Yes, it’s a beautiful day,” said the grandmother. “Listen,” she said, “you shouldn’t call\nyourself The Misfit because I know you’re a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.”\n“Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!” He was\nsquatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn’t move.\n“I pre-chate that, lady,” The Misfit said and drew a\n######################\nOutput:"}}

His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and\nJohn Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his\nkidney.\n39\n“All right!” he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. “Will you all\nshut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don’t shut up, we won’t go anywhere.”\n“It would be very educational for them,” the grandmother murmured.\n“All right,” Bailey said, “but get this: this is the only time we’re going to stop for\nanything like this. This is the one and only time.”\n“The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,” the grandmother\ndirected. “I marked it when we passed.”\n“A dirt road,” Bailey groaned.\nAfter they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother\nrecalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the\ncandle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.\n“You can’t go inside this house,” Bailey said. “You don’t know who lives there.”\n“While you all talk to the people in front, I’ll run around behind and get in a window,”\nJohn Wesley suggested.\n“We’ll all stay in the car,” his mother said.\nThey turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust.\nThe grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a\nday’s journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on\ndangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops\nof trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the\ndust-coated trees looking down on them.\n“This place had better turn up in a minute,” Bailey said, “or I’m going to turn around.”\nThe road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.\n“It’s not much farther,” the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought\ncame to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes\ndilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise\nmoved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing, the\ncat, sprang onto Bailey’s shoulder.\nThe children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown\nout the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over\nonce and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the\ndriver’s seat with the cat gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose clinging to\nhis neck like a caterpillar.\nAs soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of\nthe car, shouting, “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” The grandmother was curled up under the\n40\ndashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey’s wrath would not come down on her all at\nonce. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had\nremembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.\nBailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window\nagainst the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children’s\nmother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby,\nbut she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the\nchildren screamed in a frenzy of delight.\n“But nobody’s killed,” June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped\nout of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty\nangle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the\nchildren, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.\n“Maybe a car will come along,” said the children’s mother hoarsely.\n“I believe I have injured an organ,” said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one\nanswered her. Bailey’s teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue\nparrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the shirt. The grandmother decided that she\nwould not mention that the house was in Tennessee.\nThe road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the\nother side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and\ndeep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if\nthe occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms\ndramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered he\n######################\nOutput:"}}

If he hears it’s two\ncent in the cash register, I wouldn’t be a tall surprised if he . . .”\n“That’ll do,” Red Sam said. “Go bring these people their Co’-Colas,” and the woman\nwent off to get the rest of the order.\n“A good man is hard to find,” Red Sammy said. “Everything is getting terrible. I\nremember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.”\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion\nEurope was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you\nwould think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was\nexactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the\nlacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully\nbetween his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke\nup every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled\nan old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady.\nShe said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks\nleading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down\nwith your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to\nit. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the\nmore she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin\narbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling\nthe truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in\nit when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .”\n“Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and\nfind it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?”\n“We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the\nhouse with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!”\n“It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty\nminutes.”\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what\n######################\nOutput:"}}

John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and\nJohn Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his\nkidney.\n39\n“All right!” he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. “Will you all\nshut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don’t shut up, we won’t go anywhere.”\n“It would be very educational for them,” the grandmother murmured.\n“All right,” Bailey said, “but get this: this is the only time we’re going to stop for\nanything like this. This is the one and only time.”\n“The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,” the grandmother\ndirected. “I marked it when we passed.”\n“A dirt road,” Bailey groaned.\nAfter they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother\nrecalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the\ncandle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.\n“You can’t go inside this house,” Bailey said. “You don’t know who lives there.”\n“While you all talk to the people in front, I’ll run around behind and get in a window,”\nJohn Wesley suggested.\n“We’ll all stay in the car,” his mother said.\nThey turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust.\nThe grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a\nday’s journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on\ndangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops\nof trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the\ndust-coated trees looking down on them.\n“This place had better turn up in a minute,” Bailey said, “or I’m going to turn around.”\nThe road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.\n“It’s not much farther,” the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought\ncame to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes\ndilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise\nmoved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing, the\ncat, sprang onto Bailey’s shoulder.\nThe children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown\nout the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over\nonce and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the\ndriver’s seat with the cat gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose clinging to\nhis neck like a caterpillar.\nAs soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of\nthe car, shouting, “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” The grandmother was curled up under the\n40\ndashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey’s wrath would not come down on her all at\nonce. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had\nremembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.\nBailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window\nagainst the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children’s\nmother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby,\nbut she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. “We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the\nchildren screamed in a frenzy of delight.\n“But nobody’s killed,” June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped\nout of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty\nangle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the\nchildren, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.\n“Maybe a car will come along,” said the children’s mother hoarsely.\n“I believe I have injured an organ,” said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one\nanswered her. Bailey’s teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue\nparrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the shirt. The grandmother decided that she\nwould not mention that the house was in Tennessee.\nThe road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the\nother side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and\ndeep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if\nthe occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms\ndramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared\naround a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over.\nIt was a big black battered he\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The two boys also had guns.\n“We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed.\n41\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she\nknew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him all her life but she could not\nrecall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment,\nplacing his feet carefully so that he wouldn’t slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks,\nand his ankles were red and thin. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I see you all had you a little spill.”\n“We turned over twice!” said the grandmother.\n“Oncet”, he corrected. “We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,” he\nsaid quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\n“What you got that gun for?” John Wesley asked. “Whatcha gonna do with that gun?”\n“Lady,” the man said to the children’s mother, “would you mind calling them children to\nsit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there\nwhere you’re at.”\n“What are you telling US what to do for?” June Star asked.\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. “Come here,” said their\nmother.\n“Look here now,” Bailey began suddenly, “we’re in a predicament! We’re in . . .”\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. “You’re The\nMisfit!” she said. “I recognized you at once!”\n“Yes’m,” the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be\nknown, “but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.”\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the\nchildren. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\n“Lady,” he said, “don’t you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don’t mean. I\ndon’t reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.”\n“You wouldn’t shoot a lady, would you?” the grandmother said and removed a clean\nhandkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then\ncovered it up again. “I would hate to have to,” he said.\n“Listen,” the grandmother almost screamed, “I know you’re a good man. You don’t look\na bit like you have common blood. I know you must come from nice people!”\n“Yes mam,” he said, “finest people in the world.” When he smiled he showed a row of\nstrong white teeth. “God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy’s heart was\npure gold,” he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was\nstanding with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. “Watch them\n42\nchildren, Bobby Lee,” he said. “You know they make me nervous.” He looked at the six of them\nhuddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn’t think of\nanything to say. “Ain’t a cloud in the sky,” he remarked, looking up at it. “Don’t see no sun but\ndon’t see no cloud neither.”\n“Yes, it’s a beautiful day,” said the grandmother. “Listen,” she said, “you shouldn’t call\nyourself The Misfit because I know you’re a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.”\n“Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!” He was\nsquatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn’t move.\n“I pre-chate that, lady,” The Misfit said and drew a\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her\nchair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children’s mother put in another\ndime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap\nroutine.\n“Ain’t she cute?” Red Sam’s wife said, leaning over the counter. “Would you like to come\nbe my little girl?”\n“No I certainly wouldn’t,” June Star said. “I wouldn’t live in a broken-down place like\nthis for a million bucks!” and she ran back to the table.\n“Ain’t she cute?” the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\n“Arn’t you ashamed?” hissed the grandmother.\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with\nthese people’s order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung\nover them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table\nnearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. “You can’t win,” he said. “You can’t win,” and\nhe wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. “These days you don’t know who\nto trust,” he said. “Ain’t that the truth?”\n“People are certainly not nice like they used to be,” said the grandmother.\n“Two fellers come in here last week,” Red Sammy said, “driving a Chrysler. It was a old\nbeat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked at the\nmill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?”\n“Because you’re a good man!” the grandmother said at once.\n“Yes’m, I suppose so,” Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in\neach hand and one balanced on her arm. “It isn’t a soul in this green world of God’s that you\ncan trust,” she said. “And I don’t count nobody out of that, not nobody,” she repeated, looking\nat Red Sammy.\n“Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that’s escaped?” asked the grandmother.\n38\n“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he didn’t attack this place right here,” said the woman.\n“If he hears about it being here, I wouldn’t be none surprised to see him. If he hears it’s two\ncent in the cash register, I wouldn’t be a tall surprised if he . . .”\n“That’ll do,” Red Sam said. “Go bring these people their Co’-Colas,” and the woman\nwent off to get the rest of the order.\n“A good man is hard to find,” Red Sammy said. “Everything is getting terrible. I\nremember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.”\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion\nEurope was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you\nwould think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was\nexactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the\nlacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully\nbetween his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke\nup every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled\nan old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady.\nShe said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks\nleading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down\nwith your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to\nit. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the\nmore she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin\narbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling\nthe truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in\nit when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .”\n“Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and\nfind it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?”\n“We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the\nhouse with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!”\n“It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty\nminutes.”\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what\n######################\nOutput:"}}

His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silverrimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn’t have\non any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a\nblack hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\n“We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed.\n41\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she\nknew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him all her life but she could not\nrecall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment,\nplacing his feet carefully so that he wouldn’t slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks,\nand his ankles were red and thin. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I see you all had you a little spill.”\n“We turned over twice!” said the grandmother.\n“Oncet”, he corrected. “We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,” he\nsaid quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\n“What you got that gun for?” John Wesley asked. “Whatcha gonna do with that gun?”\n“Lady,” the man said to the children’s mother, “would you mind calling them children to\nsit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there\nwhere you’re at.”\n“What are you telling US what to do for?” June Star asked.\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. “Come here,” said their\nmother.\n“Look here now,” Bailey began suddenly, “we’re in a predicament! We’re in . . .”\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. “You’re The\nMisfit!” she said. “I recognized you at once!”\n“Yes’m,” the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be\nknown, “but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.”\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the\nchildren. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\n“Lady,” he said, “don’t you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don’t mean. I\ndon’t reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.”\n“You wouldn’t shoot a lady, would you?” the grandmother said and removed a clean\nhandkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then\ncovered it up again. “I would hate to have to,” he said.\n“Listen,” the grandmother almost screamed, “I know you’re a good man. You don’t look\na bit like you have common blood. I know you must come from nice people!”\n“Yes mam,” he said, “finest people in the world.” When he smiled he showed a row of\nstrong white teeth. “God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy’s heart was\npure gold,” he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was\nstanding with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. “Watch them\n42\nchildren, Bobby Lee,” he said. “You know they make me nervous.” He looked at the six of them\nhuddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn’t think of\nanything to say. “Ain’t a cloud in the sky,” he remarked, looking up at it. “Don’t see no sun but\ndon’t see no cloud neither.”\n“Yes, it’s a beautiful day,” said the grandmother. “Listen,” she said, “you shouldn’t call\nyourself The Misfit because I know you’re a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.”\n“Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!” He was\nsquatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn’t move.\n“I pre-chate that, lady,” The Misfit said and drew a\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her\nchair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children’s mother put in another\ndime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap\nroutine.\n“Ain’t she cute?” Red Sam’s wife said, leaning over the counter. “Would you like to come\nbe my little girl?”\n“No I certainly wouldn’t,” June Star said. “I wouldn’t live in a broken-down place like\nthis for a million bucks!” and she ran back to the table.\n“Ain’t she cute?” the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\n“Arn’t you ashamed?” hissed the grandmother.\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with\nthese people’s order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung\nover them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table\nnearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. “You can’t win,” he said. “You can’t win,” and\nhe wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. “These days you don’t know who\nto trust,” he said. “Ain’t that the truth?”\n“People are certainly not nice like they used to be,” said the grandmother.\n“Two fellers come in here last week,” Red Sammy said, “driving a Chrysler. It was a old\nbeat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked at the\nmill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?”\n“Because you’re a good man!” the grandmother said at once.\n“Yes’m, I suppose so,” Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in\neach hand and one balanced on her arm. “It isn’t a soul in this green world of God’s that you\ncan trust,” she said. “And I don’t count nobody out of that, not nobody,” she repeated, looking\nat Red Sammy.\n“Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that’s escaped?” asked the grandmother.\n38\n“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he didn’t attack this place right here,” said the woman.\n“If he hears about it being here, I wouldn’t be none surprised to see him. If he hears it’s two\ncent in the cash register, I wouldn’t be a tall surprised if he . . .”\n“That’ll do,” Red Sam said. “Go bring these people their Co’-Colas,” and the woman\nwent off to get the rest of the order.\n“A good man is hard to find,” Red Sammy said. “Everything is getting terrible. I\nremember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.”\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion\nEurope was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you\nwould think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was\nexactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the\nlacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully\nbetween his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke\nup every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled\nan old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady.\nShe said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks\nleading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down\nwith your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to\nit. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the\nmore she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin\narbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling\nthe truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in\nit when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .”\n“Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and\nfind it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?”\n“We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the\nhouse with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!”\n“It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty\nminutes.”\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Neither spoke.\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was\nan older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silverrimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn’t have\non any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a\nblack hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\n“We’ve had an ACCIDENT!” the children screamed.\n41\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she\nknew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him all her life but she could not\nrecall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment,\nplacing his feet carefully so that he wouldn’t slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks,\nand his ankles were red and thin. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I see you all had you a little spill.”\n“We turned over twice!” said the grandmother.\n“Oncet”, he corrected. “We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,” he\nsaid quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\n“What you got that gun for?” John Wesley asked. “Whatcha gonna do with that gun?”\n“Lady,” the man said to the children’s mother, “would you mind calling them children to\nsit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there\nwhere you’re at.”\n“What are you telling US what to do for?” June Star asked.\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. “Come here,” said their\nmother.\n“Look here now,” Bailey began suddenly, “we’re in a predicament! We’re in . . .”\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. “You’re The\nMisfit!” she said. “I recognized you at once!”\n“Yes’m,” the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be\nknown, “but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn’t of reckernized me.”\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the\nchildren. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\n“Lady,” he said, “don’t you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don’t mean. I\ndon’t reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.”\n“You wouldn’t shoot a lady, would you?” the grandmother said and removed a clean\nhandkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then\ncovered it up again. “I would hate to have to,” he said.\n“Listen,” the grandmother almost screamed, “I know you’re a good man. You don’t look\na bit like you have common blood. I know you must come from nice people!”\n“Yes mam,” he said, “finest people in the world.” When he smiled he showed a row of\nstrong white teeth. “God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy’s heart was\npure gold,” he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was\nstanding with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. “Watch them\n42\nchildren, Bobby Lee,” he said. “You know they make me nervous.” He looked at the six of them\nhuddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn’t think of\nanything to say. “Ain’t a cloud in the sky,” he remarked, looking up at it. “Don’t see no sun but\ndon’t see no cloud neither.”\n“Yes, it’s a beautiful day,” said the grandmother. “Listen,” she said, “you shouldn’t call\nyourself The Misfit because I know you’re a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.”\n“Hush!” Bailey yelled. “Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!” He was\nsquatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn’t move.\n“I pre-chate that, lady,” The Misfit said and drew a\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her\nchair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children’s mother put in another\ndime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap\nroutine.\n“Ain’t she cute?” Red Sam’s wife said, leaning over the counter. “Would you like to come\nbe my little girl?”\n“No I certainly wouldn’t,” June Star said. “I wouldn’t live in a broken-down place like\nthis for a million bucks!” and she ran back to the table.\n“Ain’t she cute?” the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\n“Arn’t you ashamed?” hissed the grandmother.\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with\nthese people’s order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung\nover them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table\nnearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. “You can’t win,” he said. “You can’t win,” and\nhe wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. “These days you don’t know who\nto trust,” he said. “Ain’t that the truth?”\n“People are certainly not nice like they used to be,” said the grandmother.\n“Two fellers come in here last week,” Red Sammy said, “driving a Chrysler. It was a old\nbeat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked at the\nmill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?”\n“Because you’re a good man!” the grandmother said at once.\n“Yes’m, I suppose so,” Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in\neach hand and one balanced on her arm. “It isn’t a soul in this green world of God’s that you\ncan trust,” she said. “And I don’t count nobody out of that, not nobody,” she repeated, looking\nat Red Sammy.\n“Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that’s escaped?” asked the grandmother.\n38\n“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he didn’t attack this place right here,” said the woman.\n“If he hears about it being here, I wouldn’t be none surprised to see him.

I\nremember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.”\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion\nEurope was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you\nwould think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was\nexactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the\nlacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully\nbetween his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke\nup every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled\nan old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady.\nShe said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks\nleading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down\nwith your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to\nit. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the\nmore she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin\narbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling\nthe truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in\nit when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .”\n“Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and\nfind it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?”\n“We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the\nhouse with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!”\n“It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty\nminutes.”\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He came over and sat down at a table\nnearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. “You can’t win,” he said. “You can’t win,” and\nhe wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. “These days you don’t know who\nto trust,” he said. “Ain’t that the truth?”\n“People are certainly not nice like they used to be,” said the grandmother.\n“Two fellers come in here last week,” Red Sammy said, “driving a Chrysler. It was a old\nbeat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked at the\nmill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?”\n“Because you’re a good man!” the grandmother said at once.\n“Yes’m, I suppose so,” Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in\neach hand and one balanced on her arm. “It isn’t a soul in this green world of God’s that you\ncan trust,” she said. “And I don’t count nobody out of that, not nobody,” she repeated, looking\nat Red Sammy.\n“Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that’s escaped?” asked the grandmother.\n38\n“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he didn’t attack this place right here,” said the woman.\n“If he hears about it being here, I wouldn’t be none surprised to see him. If he hears it’s two\ncent in the cash register, I wouldn’t be a tall surprised if he . . .”\n“That’ll do,” Red Sam said. “Go bring these people their Co’-Colas,” and the woman\nwent off to get the rest of the order.\n“A good man is hard to find,” Red Sammy said. “Everything is getting terrible. I\nremember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.”\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion\nEurope was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you\nwould think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was\nexactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the\nlacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully\nbetween his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke\nup every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled\nan old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady.\nShe said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks\nleading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down\nwith your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to\nit. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the\nmore she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin\narbors were still standing. “There was a secret panel in this house,” she said craftily, not telling\nthe truth but wishing that she were, “and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in\nit when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .”\n“Hey!” John Wesley said. “Let’s go see it! We’ll find it! We’ll poke all the woodwork and\nfind it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can’t we turn off there?”\n“We never have seen a house with a secret panel!” June Star shrieked. “Let’s go to the\nhouse with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can’t we go see the house with the secret panel!”\n“It’s not far from here, I know,” the grandmother said. “It wouldn’t take over twenty\nminutes.”\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. “No,” he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret\npanel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother’s\nshoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their\nvacation, that they could never do what\n######################\nOutput:"}}

June Star is also characterized by her dance and her vocal expressions of disappointment, particularly about not having fun on their vacation and her morbid fascination with the absence of fatalities in a car accident. As the sister to John Wesley, she shares a similar lack of respect towards their grandmother's concerns and preferences, agreeing with John Wesley's negative views about the states.
